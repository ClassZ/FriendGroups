# FriendGroups
This is modified [Friend Groups](http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/friend-groups/) addon (World of Warcraft) that is working with the most recent patch (eventually).

This addon is belongs to frankkkkk who is the original author. After the addon survived for more than 2 years, after the last official updated at Oct. 29. 2013, it finally stopped working with the newest battle.net [changes in Blizzard's 6.2.4 API](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20742784697). I modified it to make it work, at least for me.

Improvements, and bug reports should be addressed in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Mikeprod/FriendGroups/issues)

Time table is tight I will do my best to address the tickets

Thank you for your interest
